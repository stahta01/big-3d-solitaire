<h1>Doubles 13</h1>
<h4>Object</h4>
Remove all cards.
<h4>How to play</h4>
Cards can be removed in pairs that add 13 and are touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
Kings can be removed alone.<br>
At any point that there are empty piles in the Tableau, dealing from the Stock 
moves all the cards already in the Tableau from the right to left and moving 
them up a row to the far right if necessary making all the empty slots at the end.<br><br>
The Stock is then dealt on to these empty slots.
<h4>Settings</h4>
Automatic in off by default and can't change it.
