<h1>Russian</h1>
<h4>Object</h4>
Move all of the cards to the foundations, building up in suit from ace to king.
<h4>How to play</h4>
Russian Solitaire is similar to Yukon.<br><br>
All face-up cards in the tableau can be moved onto another column <b>by suite</b> 
regardless of how deep they are in the pile.<br><br>
The main objective is to clear the board of cards by organizing them, in ascending order, 
into four suits at the right of the game window, starting with the aces.
<br><br>
An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a <b>King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom</b>.
<h4>Settings</h4>
Automatic in on by default and can't change it.
