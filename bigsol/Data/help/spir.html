<h4>Object</h4>
Create four piles of thirteen cards each built down in suit and sequence.

Builds of cards in sequence can by moved as a unit.<br>
Empty Tableau piles can be filled with any card or build of cards.<br>
Each Tableau pile must be filled before any deal.<br>
Clicking on the Stock will deal a card on to every Tableau pile

Cards in the Foundation are no longer in play.<br>
