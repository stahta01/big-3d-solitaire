<h1>Montana or Gaps</h1>
<h4>Object</h4>
To place all cards in sequence from 2 to king, in suit.
<h4>How to play</h4>
Gaps in the leftmost column may be filled by moving a 2 of any suit there.<br>
A gap to the right of any non-King card may be filled by placing the card with the 
same suit but one rank higher into the gap.<br>
Gaps following Kings or other gaps may not be filled.<br>
Once a card is placed in a sequence starting with a 2 in the leftmost slot, it can no longer be moved.<br>
If no moves are possible (i.e., all gaps follow Kings), click in the empty pile.<br>
Any cards not in sequence will be removed, shuffled, and redealt.
<i><b>Three Redeals</b></i> are allowed.
<h4>Settings</h4>
Automatic in off by default and can't change it.
