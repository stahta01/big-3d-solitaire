<h1>Spider</h1>
<h4>Object</h4>
To have eight sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace in the foundation.<br>
<h4>How to play</h4>
Build down regardless of suit.<br>
Sequences of cards in the same suit can	be moved as a unit.<br>
Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal sequence.<br><br>
Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every pile.<br>
However, all piles must be non-empty.<br>
A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to a foundation pile.<br>
Once there, these cards are no longer in play.<br>
<h4>Options</h4>
There are three possible types of deck. Each deck has 104 cards.<br><br>
<i>Four Suits</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck is a standard double deck. There are two complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is the standard Spider deck. It is also the most difficult.
<br><br>	
<i>Two Suits</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck is a quadruple deck of Hearts and Spades only. There are four complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is not quite as diabolical as the standard four suit spider deck.
<br><br>
<i>One Suit</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck is an octuple deck of Spades only. This is the simplest of the spider decks and a good way to learn the basics.
<h4>Settings</h4>
Automatic in on by default and can't change it.
