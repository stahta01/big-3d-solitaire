<h1>Yukon</h1>
<h4>Object</h4>
Move all of the cards to the foundations, building up in suit from ace to king.
<h4>How to play</h4>
Yukon Solitaire is similar to Kondike, except there is no pile to draw from; 
all of the cards are dealt into the tableau, the seven columns in the middle.
<br><br>
Also, all face-up cards in the tableau can be moved onto another column regardless of how deep they are in the pile.
The main objective is to clear the board of cards by organizing them, in ascending order, 
into four suits at the right of the game window, starting with the aces.
<br><br>
Empty columns only can placed by <b><i>King</i></b>.
<h4>Settings</h4>
Automatic in on by default and can't change it.
