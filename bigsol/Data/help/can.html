<h1>Canfield</h1>
<h4>Object</h4>
Move all cards to the Foundation piles.
<h4>How to play</h4>
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. 
Groups of cards can be moved. An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve.
<br><br>
If the Reserve is empty, an empty slot can be filled by any card or group of cards in sequence.<br>
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste by three.<br>
If the last flip has less than three cards, that many cards are flipped for that move only.<br>
When Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order.
<br><br>
Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to first Foundation).
New Foundations are started when a card of the same rank as the first card placed during 
the dealing period are placed on empty Foundation piles.
<br><br>
Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on Aces.	Cards in Foundations are not in play.
<h4>Settings</h4>
Automatic in off by default
